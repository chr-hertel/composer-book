        <h1>Prologue</h1>
        <p class="prologue">
            Once upon a time we set out to create an open-source project.<br />
            It seemed like a small fun programming project, but eventually<br />
            it turned into this doorstopper, large enough to knock someone out.
        </p>
        <p class="prologue">
            This book will serve as a reminder that most software we rely<br />
            on is bug ridden, poorly documented, hard to comprehend at times,<br />
            and can easily grow into an untamable monstrosity if you're not<br />
            careful. So learn to say "No" a lot and don't put too much trust<br />
            into what you can read over the next couple hundred pages.
        </p>
        <p class="prologue">
            Despite all of this Composer is still an extremely<br />
            handy tool &mdash; quite contrary to this very book.
